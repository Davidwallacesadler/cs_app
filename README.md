# Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (CS:APP)
This repo is a collection of my notes and solutions as I work through the [CS:APP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu) textbook.

My goal for this repo is to serve as a way to go over this text as well as go over practice and homework problems that show the work and the steps taken to get the solution. I have found that many of the practice problems in particular are very terse and do little in terms of walking through the thought process.
