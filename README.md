# Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (CS:APP)
This repo is a collection of my notes and solutions as I work through the [Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective 3rd Edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu) textbook.

The goal for this repo is to serve as a way to document my learnings as I work through this text. It will also contain all my solutions for practice and homework problems. I have found that many of the practice problem solutions do not that show the work and the steps taken to get the solution so I will focus on making my solutions readable and followable for others and myself in the future.
