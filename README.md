# Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (CS:APP)
My goal is get better at understanding computers and how they work from a software perspective. I often write software without really knowing many lower level details, but I want to change that and educate myself. When I found [Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective 3rd Edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu) I knew it could serve as a great way to make progress towards this goal.

This repo is a collection of my notes and work as I read through this text in an effort to educate myself on lower level systems and deepen my appreciation for the technology I use on a daily basis.

It will also contain all my solutions for practice and homework problems. I have found that many of the practice problem solutions do not show the work and steps taken to get the solution so I will focus on making my solutions readable and followable for others and myself in the future.
