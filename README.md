# Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective (CS:APP)
My goal is get better at understanding computers and how they work from a software perspective. I often write software without really knowing how the high level concepts I work with map to the lower level ones that actually drive the system. 

This gives me a really uneasy feeling...
 
So, I want to change that and educate myself. 
  
When I found [Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective 3rd Edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu), I figured it could serve as a great way to make progress towards this goal.

This repo is a collection of:
- My notes 
- Coursework
- Practice Problems

I have found that many of the practice problem solutions in the textbook do not show the work and steps taken to get the solution so I will focus on making my solutions readable and followable for others and myself in the future.
