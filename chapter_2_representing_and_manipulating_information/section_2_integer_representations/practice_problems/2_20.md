# Practice 2.20

Explain how Equation 2.5 applies to the entries in the table you generated when solving Problem 2.19

Equation 2.5:

`T2U(x) = { x + 2^w (x < 0), x (x >= 0) }`

---

We can clearly see from the negative two's complement numbers that they map to large positive numbers because of how the most significant bit is interpreted as a large positive value when interpreted as an unsigned integer.
