# Practice 2.34

Fill in the following table showing the results of multiplying different 3-bit numbers, in the style of figure 2.27 (show both signed and unsigned products and representations for each step)

| Row     | x           | y           | x * y    | Truncated x * y
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------
| [A.](#a)| [100]       | [101]       | ___      |  ___       
| [B.](#b)| [010]       | [111]       | ___      |  ___     
| [C.](#c)| [110]       | [110]       | ___      |  ___      

What do you observe about the bit patterns generated by two's complement and unsighed (Problem 2.28) negation?
