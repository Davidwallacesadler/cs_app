# Practice 2.27

Write a function with the following prototype:

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */
int uadd_ok(unsigned x, unsigned y);
```

This function should return 1 if arguments x and y can be added without causing overflow.

---

From the reading in this chapter we know that we can determine if an overflow occurred if the resulting value is less than either of the arguments of the sum! 

As stated on page 124:

```
Detecting overflow of unsigned addtion:

For x and y in the range 0 <= x, y <= Umax, let s = x+y. Then the computation of s overflowed if and only if s < x (or equivalently, x < y).
```

So we could write the body of the function like this:

```c
int uadd_ok(unsigned x, unsigned y) {
    unsigned sum = x + y;
    return sum >= x && sum >= y;
}
```
