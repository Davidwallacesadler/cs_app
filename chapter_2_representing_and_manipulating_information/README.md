# Chapter 2: Representing and Manipulating Information
This chapter goes over how information is stored in computer systems with an emphasis on how we interpret this data as numerical representations such as signed and unsigned integers and floating point numbers.

The chapter is split into 4 major sections:
- Section 2.1: Information Storage
- Section 2.2: Integer Representations
- Section 2.3: Integer Arithmetic
- Section 2.4: Floating Point

See each sub-directory for notes and worked practice problems.
