# Section 2.1: Information Storage
This section goes over how we represent data on computer systems as bits. These bits are then interpreted in different ways, allowing us to represent all kinds of different information using these bits.

## Interesting Quotes
- "When we group bits together and apply some interpretation that gives meaning to the different possible bit patterns...". This is pretty much the one of the big conclusions of the book "Code". We as humans have a powerful ability to encode different meanings into things and in particular binary (on/off) states.
- "A machine-level program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as virtual memory."
